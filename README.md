Samples of my written work (technical and non-technical)

I originally authored most of these documents in MS Word, and their layout has changed after pasting the content to another tool. A short disclaimer to view these documents on a PC or a tablet, as the layout and structure of the documents might not be the best when viewed on small screens (mobile phones). In the meantime, I will work on making them accessible on all devices.

Also, note that some of these samples are assignments that I did for my technical writing certification. I have added background information in some places to give the readers a better idea of the nature of the document and the work that went into creating it.

Thank you,

Bhramara
